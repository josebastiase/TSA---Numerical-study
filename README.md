# Earth tidal analysis to estimate subsurface properties
A numerical study to study the limitations of analytical solutions when subsurface properties are estimated with TSA method.

Notes
-----
This repository includes the data and python scripts to visualize results.

Numerical simulation were set in the MOOSE environment - for more visit https://mooseframework.inl.gov/ and https://github.com/josebastiase/RHEA
The numerical simulation are contained in the ".i" files. Since numerous simulations where perfomr for this study, for each figure where simulation were perfomr, a python script was used to generate the numerical simulation files.
